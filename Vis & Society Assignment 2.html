			<h2>Subtheme: Exploring speculative investment (“flipped properties”)</h2>
			<h3>Dataset</h3>
			<ol>
				This dataset presents extensive statistics on residential sales within the City of Boston spanning from 2000 to 2023. It provides detailed information on recorded sales transactions, including seller and buyer data, sale prices, property locations, and the classification of sales as "flips." The dataset is sourced from The Warren Group. As someone with a background in interior architecture, I was intrigued by the concept of fix-and-flip housing and sought to understand the nuances of how these properties are transformed. This dataset offers the opportunity to explore these differences and gain fresh insights into flipped properties.
			</ol>
			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>What is the spatial distribution pattern of flipped properties across different neighborhoods in Boston? </li>
				<li>Did COVID-19 impact transactions in Boston, and what trends emerged during this period?</li>
				<li> Who comprises the buyer/seller types for flipped properties, and to what extent do their purchases contribute to the escalation of rental and housing prices (based on data)?</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>

					To gain a preliminary understanding of the prevalence of flips in Boston, a pie chart was created to visualize the distribution of total transactions, revealing that flips constitute a relatively small portion. The flip is defined by Metropolitan Area Planning Council as any property that has been sold within two years of its most recent purchase date. The durations categorized as short, medium, and long term (6 months, 6 to 12 months, and 12 to 24 months, respectively).

					The map showed an even distribution across neighborhoods such as Back Bay, Beacon Hill, South End, and North End. While flips are less prevalent in the downtown area and its vicinity, they tend to cluster in regions where has a higher building density. One of our readings suggest that investor activity is prominent in high-density urban submarkets with relatively lower housing prices, particularly those areas with a higher proportion of renters, Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). Further exploration with additional data is desired to delve deeper into this aspect.

					Investigating the impact of COVID-19 on the flip market, data analysis revealed that average prices of flipped properties exceeded those of non-flipped properties, peaking in the 2020s. However, the total count of flipped properties decreased during this period, indicating a potential surge in average prices rather than an increase in transaction volume.

					A closer examination of price differences between years highlighted a significant increase in 2020 compared to preceding years. This new graph raises another question about whether flips are contributing to housing market unaffordability and whether the “big guys”, such as private equity firms, are driving market fluctuations.

					Further exploration into buyer-seller dynamics within the flips revealed that transactions predominantly involve non-investors, suggesting that flips are not solely driven by investor activities. Flipped properties are often purchased by non-investers who are more likely to be the individuals with genuine housing needs rather than investors seeking profits through resale from other investors.

					Analysis of average price trends between investors and non-investors demonstrated similar patterns, albeit with differences in transaction sizes. Investors tend to target higher-priced properties, potentially impacting affordability for certain segments of the population. Conversely, non-investors tend to target properties priced below one million, assuming a parallel market where investor activity may have minimal impact over those non-investor who happen to sell their property after living there for two years.

				<figcaption>
					Interestingly, condos emerge as the predominant property type for flips among both investors and non-investors. However, the considerable price discrepancy between investor and non-investor purchases—nearly three times higher for investors—suggests potential variations in location or property size.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>Overall, this comprehensive data analysis of residential sales in Boston from 2000 to 2023, sourced from The Warren Group, delves into the spatial distribution of flipped properties, the impact of COVID-19 on transactions, and the dynamics of buyer/seller types. Despite flips constituting a small portion of transactions, they exhibit an even distribution across neighborhoods and a notable increase in average prices, particularly in the 2020s. While investors predominantly target higher-priced properties like condos, non-investors focus on more affordable options, suggesting a possible parallel market. However, it's challenging to conclude that professional investors haven't influenced the market dynamics against mainstream viewpoints. Given that condos often consist of multiple units, their involvement in flips could contribute to evictions or rent increases. Further exploration is necessary to fully comprehend these implications.
